# Sam's very own book catalog written with ReactJS and Redux!

To run:

 * clone from github
 * npm install
 * npm start

This is a simple book catalog that lets you select from a list of books and gives information.  The idea is that it contains a full cycle of views, actions, reducers, and state updates.  It's based off UDemy course called React-Redux.
